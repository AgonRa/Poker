Pot Odds vs. Equity Calculator

This Program will compare the Pot odds of a poker table (how much money there is on the table),
to the Equity of your hand (how high is the chance to win).

It will let you know if it is a good choice to call or fold over the long run.

For this you will need to know your Outs (The amount of cards which will improve your hands)
and if you are on the Turn or River (1 more card or two more cards)
When you are on the flop, just choose Option "2"

This Program does not include implied odds
